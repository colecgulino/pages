I am a Staff Machine Learning Robotics Engineer at Tesla Optimus. Previously I worked in self-driving cars at Waymo Research and Uber ATG. I am passionate about building general autonomous systems that can reason like humans do. Here, I will post a little about me and some personal projects I've done for fun.
